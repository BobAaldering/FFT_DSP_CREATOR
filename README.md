# FFT DSP CREATOR

This project provides a program for the ESP32, in which this microcontroller will serve as a spectrum analyzer. Signals are generated, showing the spectrum. Several functions will be added that display the spectrum both before and after filtering.

# Useful links

Below are a number of links that provide a detailed explanation of how to use the 'FFT' within the official `esp_dsp` library:

1. The complete [documentation](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/esp-dsp/en/latest/esp-dsp-apis.html) of `esp_dsp`.
2. A link to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/espressif/esp-dsp) of `esp_dsp`.
3. A complete [explanation/discussion](https://github.com/espressif/esp-dsp/issues/4) how to use the 'FFT' in general on the ESP32.
4. An [explanation](https://github.com/espressif/esp-dsp/issues/21) how to retrieve the actual frequencies of the peak amplitudes from a `Bin` (scale generated by 'FFT').

# Used dependencies

This project makes use of several functions provided in the `esp_dsp` library (which contains official functionality for DSP within the ESP32). However, it must be added to the project by running the following command in an IDF terminal:

```
idf.py add-dependency "espressif/esp-dsp"
```
